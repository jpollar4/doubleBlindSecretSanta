# Double Blind Secret Santa!!!!

This project was created as a tool for my friend groups double blind secret santa.

## What is Double Blind Secret Santa

Double Blind Secret Santa works like this:

- The party at large comes up with a theme (perhaps... Mario?)
- Everyone thinks of a phrase or word to represent their desired gift (such as, "Peach", or "Fat Luigi")
- Now, the phrases are distributed to each member of the party. So All you have is a phrase, you don't know to whom it belongs
- Next, spend a few weeks crafting a present that emobies that phrase
- On the day of that party everyone brings their gifts and says "Okay, I had 'Fat Luigi', who had that?" While showing their hand made crocheted fat Luigi
- Everyone has a laugh and the gift is given
